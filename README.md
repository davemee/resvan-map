#RESVAN/MAP

Based on the Moves-app API and uses Twitter for login. Plots on a Google map.

See implementation at http://www.resvan.com/map/

Note: The code in this repository is built mostly using copy/paste from other projects, is made during one weekend, and is a typical "hack". 


##Analyze your Moves data

Visualize your Moves-app storylines on an interative map, based on Google Maps. Define zones by drawing circles and analyze the amount of time that you have spent in each zone during the selected time interval.

You can use this to find out how much time you have spent at work, time spent in a city, and time spent at bus stops, or other places.
